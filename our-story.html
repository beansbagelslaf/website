        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <p>
          Bean's Bagels was founded by Julian Shorter and Jack Marich, two
          freshmen at Lafayette College. We were tired of waking up on weekends
          feeling hungry and sluggish, and we recognized the need for a solution
          to revitalize our mornings.
        </p>
        <p>
          As natives of New Jersey, breakfast sandwiches have been a staple of
          our diet, whether from our local bagel store or homemade. We decided
          it was time to bring our expertise to Lafayette and assist students
          like us, exactly when they need it most.
        </p>
        <p>
          We aim to expand Bean's Bagels across the entire campus, and your
          support is what drives us forward every weekend. If you enjoy our
          sandwiches, please spread the word to your friends, helping us
          continue to deliver awesome breakfast options to Lafayette each
          weekend.
